  <main>
    <p class="p1">My name is Ryan Papsin. I live in Arizona and have for most of my life. I have a three almost four
      year old
      daughter.</p>

    <p class="p2"> I graduated high school in 2004. In 2006 I enlisted into the U.S. Army, where I served for over 11
      1/2 years.
    </p>

    <p class="p3">After leaving the military in 2018, I worked as a barber for roughly three years. My current goals are
      focused
      around school/coding.</p>
